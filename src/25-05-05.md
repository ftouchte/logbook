### (25-05-05 00:08:37) Raw hit cuts 
The current dev version of coatjava, after 12.0.5t, does not reconstruct tracks. Example, in the run, 21494.00041, tracks are reconstructed with coatjava 12.0.3t but not with dev. What is strange is that, the cut on leadingEdgeTime is more restrictive in 12.0.3t compared to dev. All lot of things have changed since then : ahdc geometry; raw hit cuts are now load from a ccdb. I think we have a lot of mismatches in the reconstruction due to the update in the ahdc geometry. To confirm this, I have to run some simulations first. I planned to ask Mathieu how to do that. That will be a good opportunity to define a t0 for simulation.
