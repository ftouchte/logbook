### (25-04-05 19:48:30) Study of the zero suppress effect 
The previous logs show the consistency of the **wftime** with the different mode of ZS. The first channel (== wftime) refers to the time of the first sample (expressed in term of bin number) according this reference.

### (25-04-05 18:49:30) PR approved (t2d implemented) 
This PR has been approved yesterday. I just notice that, for the case of the ATOF, the key_value may not be the best one. I need to know the range of each sector, layer, component for the ATOF.
