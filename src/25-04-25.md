### (25-04-25 12:32:05) A unified ALERT expert 
from now, I'am the unique ALERT expert. I have the responsability the contact remote AHDC and ATOF expert on their personnal phone number. 

### (25-04-25 12:30:41) Target purge 
Whitney proposes to purge the target at the beginning of each run. This can be not productive. So we (almost) agree to do 3 purges per day. One for each shift take over. 

### (25-04-25 12:23:20) AHDC reconstruction review 
I closed this PR [#599](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/coatjava/pull/599), as it highlights the fact that we need a whole review of the reconstrcution service. It's good, but it is not a priority. Let's analyse the data ! 

### (25-04-25 12:04:37) Target purge 
When we change the gas type, we should do a long 1 hour purge (6 auto purge of 10 minutes). When we don't change the gas type, a regular short (auto) purge is sufficient : to be done once per day. Let's say every day after the RC meeting.
