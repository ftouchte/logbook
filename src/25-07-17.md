### (25-07-17 13:21:29) A track study 
Started yesterday. The path and dEdx variables have been computed by Eric one month ago. dEdx was stored in AHDC::track instead of AHDC::fktrack. This PR should fixed it: [https://github.com/JeffersonLab/coatjava/pull/752](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/coatjava/pull/752)

cf. code in analysis/track.cpp
